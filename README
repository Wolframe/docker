chroot experiments
------------------

things to check out
- image creation to get first set of bare gold images
- cloning and describing build/test images

software to check out
- Unix chroot
- Linux systemd-spawnd
- FreeBSD jails
- NetBSD sysjail
- OpenVZ/Parallels (Linux)
- higher level tools (image provisioning and management)
  - Linux lxc-tools
    - the scripts look a little bit alpha, on Arch many things break
    - too low-level, management only in scripts and a config file with
      parameters for the script
 - docker
   - ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker -d -g /data/work/docker
   - nice image creation, more sort of a sharing in the cloud thing
   - nice for szenario descriptions
   - base images are gold images? how to create your own?
   - seems to be alpha, some images are sticking around, runaway device
     maps, etc.
 - vagrant 
 - packer
- SCM software
 - cfengine
 - salt

setarch linux32
chroot, path is inherited from host!

ideas:
- download required packages, isos, keys, etc. Stowe them away in a 
  download archive (so repeatability of builds is ensured without
  relying on external services)
- have some simple installation scripts which can generate chroot jail
- import them as basic images for docker
- start to describe derived images for building/testing, etc. 
  (this helps also developers of Wolframe, they can take those images as
  basis)
- there are image snapshots but they are not "golden" as we can always
  rebuild them with Dockerfile description. Inheritance of descriptions
  is extremly useful in this situation.
